# Program-3

This program involves both written and programming tasks related to algorithm analysis (Big O notation). In the written part, there is analysis of the time complexity of two functions (func and func2) based on their operations. In the programming part, there is a module called "bigo" containing four functiosn tha tdetermine whether a given value is in list using different search methods. There is also a graphical analysis of Big O complexity of these search functions that compares their running times as the size of th elist increases using Python's TimeIt module.
